# Critical Assumptions That Need Validation

## 🚨 UNVALIDATED ASSUMPTIONS

### **1. Query Distribution (80/15/5)**
**Assumption**: 80% simple, 15% medium, 5% complex queries
**Reality**: Unknown - could be 60/30/10 or 95/4/1
**Impact**: Changes cost savings from 95% to 85-99%

**How to validate:**
```bash
./useq validate start
# Run 50+ diverse queries
# Check actual distribution in report
```

### **2. Vector Search Accuracy**
**Assumption**: Vector search is significantly better than keyword search
**Reality**: Unknown - keyword search might be 90% as good for 0% cost
**Impact**: Could eliminate need for VectorDB entirely

**How to validate:**
```bash
./useq validate search
# Compare vector vs keyword results
# Measure user preference rates
```

### **3. Classification Accuracy**
**Assumption**: Automatic classification matches human judgment
**Reality**: Unknown - might misclassify 30-40% of queries
**Impact**: Wrong routing leads to poor UX or unnecessary costs

**How to validate:**
```bash
# Manual classification prompts during validation mode
# Compare automatic vs manual classification
# Aim for >80% accuracy
```

### **4. User Query Complexity**
**Assumption**: Most users ask simple questions
**Reality**: Developers might ask more complex questions than assumed
**Impact**: Higher Tier 3 usage = higher costs

**How to validate:**
```bash
# Log real developer queries over 1 week
# Analyze complexity patterns
# Adjust tier thresholds based on data
```

### **5. Embedding Value Proposition**
**Assumption**: Semantic search worth $0.000005 per query
**Reality**: Keyword search might be sufficient
**Impact**: Could save 100% of embedding costs

**How to validate:**
```bash
# A/B test: Vector search vs SQLite FTS
# Measure accuracy difference
# Calculate cost per accuracy point
```

## 📊 Data Collection Plan

### **Week 1: Baseline Measurement**
```bash
# Day 1-3: Collect 50+ queries without classification
./useq validate start

# Day 4-5: Manual classification of collected queries
# Review analytics/query_analysis_*.json

# Day 6-7: Search method comparison
./useq validate search
```

### **Week 2: System Validation**
```bash
# Day 1-3: Run with 3-tier classification
# Compare predicted vs actual costs

# Day 4-5: User satisfaction testing
# Rate response quality by tier

# Day 6-7: Generate final validation report
./useq validate report
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Classification System is Worth It IF:**
- [ ] Classification accuracy >80%
- [ ] Actual cost savings >80% 
- [ ] User satisfaction >4/5 for all tiers
- [ ] Vector search preferred >70% of time
- [ ] System complexity justified by benefits

**Alternative Paths IF Criteria Fail:**

### **If Vector Search Not Worth It:**
```bash
# Remove VectorDB entirely
# Use SQLite FTS for Tier 2
# Result: Zero embedding costs, simpler architecture
```

### **If Distribution is Wrong:**
```bash
# Adjust tier patterns based on real data
# Revise cost estimates
# Update documentation with actual numbers
```

### **If Classification is Inaccurate:**
```bash
# Improve pattern matching
# Add machine learning classification
# Or simplify to 2-tier system
```

## 🔍 What to Look For

### **Red Flags:**
- Classification accuracy <70%
- Actual costs >2x predicted
- User satisfaction <3/5 for any tier
- Vector search preferred <50% of time

### **Green Flags:**
- Distribution within 10% of predicted
- Cost savings >85%
- High user satisfaction across tiers
- Clear preference for vector search

## 📋 Validation Commands

```bash
# Start validation
./useq validate start

# Check progress
./useq validate status

# Compare search methods
./useq validate search

# Generate report
./useq validate report

# Export raw data
./useq validate export
```

## 🎯 Honest Questions to Answer

1. **Do developers actually ask simple questions 80% of the time?**
2. **Is semantic search noticeably better than keyword search?**
3. **Are the cost savings worth the added complexity?**
4. **Would SQLite FTS + MCP be simpler and almost as good?**
5. **Are you solving a real problem or building cool tech?**

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### **Scenario A: Assumptions Validated**
```
✅ 80/15/5 distribution confirmed
✅ Vector search clearly better
✅ 95% cost reduction achieved
→ Proceed with full implementation
```

### **Scenario B: Assumptions Partially Wrong**
```
⚠️ 60/30/10 distribution (more complex queries)
⚠️ Vector search only slightly better
⚠️ 85% cost reduction (still good)
→ Adjust expectations, continue with modifications
```

### **Scenario C: Assumptions Mostly Wrong**
```
❌ 40/40/20 distribution (very complex queries)
❌ Keyword search just as good
❌ 60% cost reduction (not worth complexity)
→ Simplify to SQLite FTS + MCP only
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Implement validation system** ✅ (Done)
2. **Collect 50+ real queries** (Your task)
3. **Analyze results honestly** (Critical)
4. **Adjust implementation** based on data
5. **Document real performance** (not estimates)

**Remember**: It's better to have a simple system that works than a complex system based on wrong assumptions.
